    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1 cup olive oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags
            work as well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a 
            meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breases, evenly coating both
            sides.
        </li>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breat to the bread crumb
            mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for
            10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to simmer.
            Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will
            finish cooking in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with about 1/3 cup of tomato
            sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh
            basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over the top and drizzle with 1 
            tablespoon olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts 
            are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
